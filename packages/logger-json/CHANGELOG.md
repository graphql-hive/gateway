### Patch Changes

- [#642](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/pull/642) [`30e41a6`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/gateway/commit/30e41a6f5b97c42ae548564bce3f6e4a92b1225f) Thanks [@ardatan](https://github.com/ardatan)! - New JSON-based logger

  By default, it prints pretty still to the console unless NODE_ENV is production.
  For JSON output, set the `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable to `json`.
